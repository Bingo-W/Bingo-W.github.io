  Hey I am Bin, welcome to my homepage!

 I am a PhD student supervised by Prof. [Emine Yilmaz](https://sites.google.com/site/emineyilmaz/) at University College London, affiliated with [Web Intelligence](https://wi.cs.ucl.ac.uk/) of [Centre for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/). I also serve as the Bloomberg PhD Fellow, advised by Dr. [Edgar Meij](https://edgar.meij.pro/). While at UCL, I have spent my summer time at Bloomberg (in 2024) as a AI intern, supervised by Dr. [Mohamed Yahya](https://myahya.org/) and Dr. [Sawan Kumar](https://sawankumar28.github.io/).

 Prior to pursuing my Ph.D. degree, I obtained a Master's degree under the supervision of Prof. [Shangsong Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=4uggVcIAAAAJ&hl=en) (also advised by Dr. [Zaiqiao Meng](https://mengzaiqiao.github.io/) and Dr. [Qiang Zhang](https://qiangairesearcher.github.io/)) at Sun Yat-sen University. I also have a wonderful research collaboration with Dr. Qiang Zhang at Zhejiang University.

 My research interests lies in the area of machine learning, information retrieval and natural language processing. My current focus is Agentic AI and Self-improving AI, and recently I focus on how to optimize LLM-agent for tool utilization.

 Please feel free to drop me an email if you are interested in cooperating with me.
